Title of project: PORTLANDEVENTS.ORG

## OVERVIEW

Problem Domain: 

People are naturally somewhat indecisive when it comes to going outside of their homes and doing something new and most importantly fun.  Furthermore, we are all overwhelmed with information on a daily basis, such that, when it comes to making a decision, there is simply too much information to go through. This usually yields the lack of a decision and therefore increases complacency. 

Problem Solution: 

Portland Events organization, solves this problem by presenting users with a variety of activities that will allow them to set a few parameters and then give them new and exciting options to try out around the PDX area. By utilizing a random generator tool, it further allows users to explore ideas/possibilities that they might otherwise overlook.
